sofo
====

"sofo" is Couch in Esperanto. Or so I hear.

**Status**:
Researching. Development not yet started.  Currently on hold as other work takes priority.

## Purpose

REST access to Couchbase related APIs.

The couchbase ecosystem provides several miscellaneous APIs.  For example, sync_gateway provides a REST API for accessing
data it is syncing and for administering it. CBFS also provides access via REST.  Couchbase 2.0 provides admin access via
REST as well
